# Contributing ❤️‍🔥
It’s great that you are here. It means you have thought about contributing to our Examples repository, and this makes us _thrilled_. Please, don’t let anything deter you from doing it. We love to collaborate and, most importantly, **you belong here**!

Here are a few guidelines to help you get started in the best way possible and avoid wasting your time with trivialities. That being said, if you feel something doesn’t apply to you, we won’t be mad (we just may take longer to reply) - more importantly: let us know. Our [discord server](https://xata.io/discord) is the best place to reach us quickly.

## Create an Example
1. If there isn’t yet an issue, please open one. (this is important so 2 people don’t work on the same thing)
2. Please join the [Xata Discord Community](https://xata.io/discord) if you haven't so we can collaborate with a shorter feedback loop
3. You’ll get a greenlight from a maintainer on your issue.
4. Now [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo), roll up your sleeves, and get busy!

## Open an Issue
