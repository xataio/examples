# Contributing ❤️‍🔥

It’s great that you are here. It means you have thought about contributing to our Examples repository, and this makes us _thrilled_. Please, don’t let anything deter you from doing it. We love to collaborate and, most importantly, **you belong here**!

Here are a few guidelines to help you get started in the best way possible and avoid wasting your time with trivialities. That being said, if you feel something doesn’t apply to you, we won’t be mad (we just may take longer to reply) - more importantly: let us know. Our [discord server](https://xata.io/discord) is the best place to reach us quickly.
