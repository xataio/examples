# Xata Examples

Our lab for Proof-of-Concepts, tooling, and example cases.
Your one-stop-shop to get your project up and running in minutes.

## Structure 🏗

- `apps/`: POCs (proof-of-concept) and Templates to be installed and built on top of.
- `packages/` : resources we publish to the NPM Registry to be consumed by other projects.
- `functions/`: the BFF (Backend For Frontend) example deployments. To serve as a security layer and provide connection to your Xata Database.
- `providers/`: vanilla example deployments every serverless provider
- `schemas/` : "headless schemas" for the most common data-structures to be copied and pushed from anywhere.
- `tools/`: the utilities we use to maintain this monorepo
