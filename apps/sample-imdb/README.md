### Setup üß±

To have your own local instance of this app, you will need 2 API keys, and your deployment URL.

- [`XATA_API_TOKEN`](https://xata.io/docs/concepts/api-keys): to connect your own Xata workspace.
- [`OMDB_API_TOKEN`](https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx): used as fallback to complement whenever there's missing data in our tables.
- `VERCEL_URL`: popullated by Vercel, on your local environment it‚Äôs your local server url (`https://localhost:3000` by default).

Once you have those keys, you can create your own `.env` or `.env.local` as shown in `.env.template`.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Remember to **never** share this tokens in unsecured connections.

### Run Locally üßë‚Äç‚úàÔ∏è

- Run the `dev` task to compile and serve it using Webpack.
- Run `turbo:dev` to compile and serve it using Turbopack.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Turbopack does not support PostCSS, so it is important to replace `globals.css` import with `dist.css`.
