> üí° You will need the latest version of the Xata CLI in order to use Xata Workers. We recommend installing `@xataio/cli` globally in your system with `npm -g install @xata.io/cli@latest`. But if you don't wish to do so, it is possible to add to your project dependencies and run it through the package manager.

**Connect this project to a Xata workspace and database**

```bash
xata init
```

**Configure Xata Workers**

```bash
xata workers init
```

**Start the app and run the Xata Worker concurrently**

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Deploying Your Own

To deploy the Xata worker you need to run:

```bash
xata workers upload
```

Finally, build your app and serve from your provider of choice.
