# Welcome to [Astro](https://astro.build)

## 🪄 Creating a project

```bash
# create a new project in my-awesome-app
npx degit xataio/examples/apps/starter-astro my-awesome-app
```

## 🦋 Initialize your database

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), you need to initialize your database:

```bash
npm run xata:init
```

## ⌨️ Developing

You can now start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
